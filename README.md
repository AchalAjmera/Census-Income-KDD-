# Census-Income-KDD-
In this project, I am working through the Income Prediction problem associated with the Adult Income Census dataset. The goal is to accurately predict whether or not someone is making more or less than $50,000 a year. While working through this problem, I am following a framework I use to attack all my machine learning problems. It includes the following steps:

Load Libraries
Load Data
Analyze Data
Feature Engineering
Modeling
Algorithm Tuning
Finalizing the Model
